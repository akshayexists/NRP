abstract = {Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have gained a lot of attention recently as a mode of converting organic matter into electricity. In this study, a compost-based microbial fuel cell that generates bioelectricity by biodegradation of organic matter is developed. Grass cuttings, along with leaf mold, rice bran, oil cake (from mustard plants) and chicken droppings (waste from chickens) were used as organic waste. The electric properties of the MFC under anaerobic fermentation condition were investigated along with the influence of different types of membranes, the mixing of fly ash, and different types of electrode materials. It is observed that the maximum voltage was increased by mixing fly ash. Cellophane showed the highest value of voltage (around 350mV). Bamboo charcoal is good for anode material; however carbon fiber is better for the cathode material in terms of optimization of power generated. This developed MFC is a simple cell to generate electricity from organic waste.}

The characteristic features of the porous structure and properties of cellulose films regenerated from cellulose solutions in the N‐methylmorpholine‐ N‐oxide (NMMO) and cellophane films were compared. Generally, cellulose films obtained from solutions in NMMO have a higher permeability and a lower rejection (as measured using Orange II dye) as compared to cellophane films. It was also found that the cellulose films have a higher ultimate strength and modulus, whereas the cellophane films are characterized by higher elongation at break.},

To enhance the generated electrical power, the potential application of several organic compounds as mediators in a C. melibiosica-based fuel cell was examined in this study. The choice of compounds was based upon observed cyclic voltammetry reversible electrochemical behavior at potentials appropriate for mediated electron transfer. Among the studied mediators, methylene blue, methyl orange, methyl red and neutral red significantly increased the current and power outputs in comparison with those obtained with a mediatorless yeast-based fuel cell.}

The established extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms in the presence and absence of exogenous mediators are summarized and discussed. The approaches applied for improvement of mediator-less yeast-based biofuel cells performance are also presented. The overview of the literature shows that biofuel cells utilizing yeasts as biocatalysts generate power density in the range of 20 to 2440mW/m2, which values are comparable with the power achieved when bacteria are used instead. The electrons' origin and the contribution of the glycolysis, fermentation, aerobic respiration, and phosphorylation to the EET are commented. The reported enhanced current generation in aerobic conditions presumes reconsideration of some basic MFC principles. The challenges towards the practical application of the yeast-based biofuel cells are outlined.}

Maximum power and current with MB concentration of 300 μM were obtained. Resistances were applied to control the electron flow from anode to cathode chambers. Data were recorded through an online data-logger. Polarization curves with and without mediator were analyzed in the fabricated cell. MB had good ability to enhance power generation.

@article{Shukla,
   abstract = {One type of genuine fuel cell that does hold promise in the long-term is the biological fuel cell. Unlike conventional fuel cells, which employ hydrogen, ethanol and methanol as fuel, biological fuel cells use organic products produced by metabolic processes or use organic electron donors utilized in the growth processes as fuels for current generation. A distinctive feature of biological fuel cells is that the electrode reactions are controlled by biocatalysts, i.e. the biological redox-reactions are enzymatically driven, while in chemical fuel cells catalysts such as platinum determine the electrode kinetics. This article provides a brief introduction to biological fuel cells along with their envisaged applications. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that continuously converts chemical energy to electrical energy for as long as fuel and oxidant are supplied to it. Beginning with the space programme of the sixties and followed by the energy crisis of the seventies, we have seen a truly substantial improvement in generic fuel-cell technologies 1-3. Albeit their high operational-efficiency, the advantages of these fuel cells are partially offset by the high cost of catalysts, high operational-temperatures, and the corrosive electro-lytes employed with them. In this regard, biological fuel cells 4-6 are both attractive and promising. Unlike chemical fuel cells, biological fuel cells operate under mild reaction conditions, namely ambient operational temperature and pressure. They also employ neutral electrolyte and use inexpensive catalysts such as platinum. In biological fuel cells, the catalyst is either a microorganism as simple as Baker's yeast or an enzyme 7-11. Biological fuel cells convert the chemical energy of carbohydrates, such as sugars and alcohols, directly into electric energy. As most organic substrates undergo combustion with the evolution of energy, bio-catalysed oxidation of organic substances by oxygen at the two electrode interfaces provides a means for the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. In normal microbial catabolism, a substrate such as carbohydrate is oxidized initially without participation of oxygen, while its electrons are taken up by an enzyme-active site, which acts as a reduced intermediate 12 , described as follows.},

   abstract = {Background-Most cells possess a sophisticated mechanism for sensing glucose and responsing to it appropriately. Glucose sensing and signaling in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae represents an important paradigm for understanding how extracellular signals lead to changes in the gene expression program in eukaryotes. Scope of review-This review focuses on the yeast glucose sensing and signaling pathways that operate in a highly regulated and cooperative manner to bring about glucose-induction of HXT gene expression. Major conclusions-The yeast cells possess a family of glucose transporters (HXTs), with different kinetic properties. They employ three major glucose signaling pathways-Rgt2/Snf3, AMPK, and cAMP-PKA-to express only those transporters best suited for the amounts of glucose available. We discuss the current understanding of how these pathways are integrated into a regulatory network to ensure efficient uptake and utilization of glucose. General significance-Elucidating the role of multiple glucose signals and pathways involved in glucose uptake and metabolism in yeast may reveal the molecular basis of glucose homeostasis in humans, especially under pathological conditions, such as hyperglycemia in diabetics and the elevated rate of glycolysis observed in many solid tumors.},

Research and progress on PFSAs, especially when considered with their applications, are at the forefront of bridging electrochemistry and polymer (physics), which have also opened up development of state-of-the-art in situ characterization techniques as well as multiphysics computation models. Topics reviewed stem from correlating the various physical (e.g., mechanical) and transport properties with morphology and structure across time and length scales. In addition, topics of recent interest such as structure/transport correlations and modeling, composite PFSA membranes, degradation phenomena, and PFSA thin films are presented.

However{,} there are significant challenges in developing paper-based devices at the system level{,} which contain integrated paper-based power sources. Here{,} we report a microfabricated paper-based bacteria-powered battery that is capable of generating power from microbial metabolism. The battery on paper showed a very short start-up time relative to conventional microbial fuel cells (MFCs); paper substrates eliminated the time traditional MFCs required to accumulate and acclimate bacteria on the anode. Only four batteries connected in series provided desired values of current and potential to power an LED for more than 30 minutes. The battery featured (i) a low-cost paper-based proton exchange membrane directly patterned on commercially available parchment paper and (ii) paper reservoirs for holding the anolyte and the catholyte for an extended period of time. Based on this concept{,} we also demonstrate the use of paper-based test platforms for the rapid characterization of electricity-generating bacteria. This paper-based microbial screening tool does not require external pumps/tubings and represents the most rapid test platform (<50 min) compared with the time needed by using traditional screening tools (up to 103 days) and even recently proposed MEMS arrays (< 2 days)."}
