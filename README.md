# Nanyang Research Programme Project Files - Microbial Fuel Cells
You can find the report and abstract for our project in this repo. I could make the raw CSV files from the Voltmeters available, but I personally prefer the [cleaned Excel version](MFC_Data.xlsx).

I'll just add a quick rundown on what we tried to do.
The entire premise of the project was that Microbial Fuel Cells hold a great deal of potential as an educational aid, however, due to cost constraints, it ends up inaccessible to educational institutions. Considering Nafion:tm:, the standard for commercially available Proton Exchange Membranes, is prohibitively expensive, we honed in on replacing this barrier to access. With some brainstorming and literature review, we honed in on 3 candidates: Cellophane, Dialysis Tubing, and Baking Paper.

Overall, we were able to propose an alternative, Baking Paper with the following performance characteristics:
 - Higher peak Voltage compared to Nafion
 - Lower Lifespan (Which might actually benefit students who could set it up in the morning and observe a full cycle of a MFC voltage curve without having to wait for 24 hours)
 - Significantly Cheaper
